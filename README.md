Nah but seriously:

```javascript
let j = {
    interests: [
        "software", 
        "investing", //Sometimes ğŸ“ˆ and sometimes ğŸ“‰
        "poker", //haha investing and poker? yes. 
        "music production" 
    ],
    degrees: [
        {
            school: "Stevens Institute of Technology",
            type: "Master of Science",
            major: "Financial Engineering",
            certificate: "Algorithmic Trading Strategies"
        },
        {
            school: "Stevens Institute of Technology",
            type: "Bachelor of Engineering",
            major: "Software Engineering",
            minor: "Computer Science"
        }
    ],
    website: "https://www.jthepanda.com/" //click the galaxy
}
```

Oh, I almost forgot: 

```javascript
j.languages = [...arrayOfProgrammingLanguages].sort(compareByProficiency).splice(0, 6)

console.log(j.languages)
```

```bash
> ["JavaScript", "Python", "R", "C#", "Java", "C++"]
>
```
